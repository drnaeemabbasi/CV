                <li>Successfully developed and established a new criterion to evaluate greenhouse gas emissions and
                    mitigation through extensive fieldwork, a holistic approach, rigorous data analytics, statistical
                    modelling and machine learning modelling techniques (with McGill University, PhD Project).</li>
                <li>Actively participated in writing grant applications that fetched 1.6 million dollars in research
                    funding. Proactively maintained an active collaboration with the graduate committee and AAFC
                    scientists

                <li>Introduced and aggressively marketed high-efficiency irrigation systems in target segments through
                    demonstrations, workshops, coaching and seminars. This resulted in the successful installation and
                    commissioning of 350 acres of drip irrigation, 500 acres of pipe irrigation and 20 acres of
                    sprinkler

                    in the field, through efficient teamwork, and management (With SRSP and WFP).</li>
                <li>I realised that the Badin district in Pakistan (my mother’s hometown) has one of the lowest literacy
                    rates. I partnered with local communities and started a small school with two campuses. We encourage
                    parents to send their kids to school and aim to provide quality education for all. Currently, there
                    are
                    more than 200 students enrolled.</li>
                <li>Managed two rice, one wheat, and one honeydew melon crops from land preparation to marketing while
                    managing funds, staffing, procurement, technical consulting and arranging logistics in between.</li>
